            Ingredients
        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            Steps
        </h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites have almost set, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
            <li>Let cook until whites have set, yolks are still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate. Garnish with pepper and flaky salt, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
